											<h2>About Me</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Currently a Junior undergraduate student at Texas A&M University-Commerce pursing a major
										in Computer Science. I love learning about the different ways that technologies can be applied to
										help solve problems. I hope that in the future I'll be able use these skills to help solve problems I'm
										invested in or to develop my own personal projects.</p>

									<h2>Projects</h2>
									<p>Listed below are a couple of personal projects that I have worked on in my free time. 
									My previous classes haven't provided me course work that I would consider as projects.
									However, the course work for the two Computer Science classes I'm taking this semester might change that.
									After I complete those courses, I plan to place any notable work I've done in them here.</p>

										<span class="image"><img src="images/img3.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the Cracker Barrel Peg Project" /></span>
										<h3><b>Cracker Barrel Peg Game</b></h3>
										<p>Developed using the Pygame Zero game engine on the MU python editor, this project simulates 
										the Cracker Barrel peg game. In order to simulate this game, I used 1-d arrays to represent the
										pegs on the board and if-statements to check the validatity of the player's moves. In order to
										beat the game, the player must remove all but one peg from the board. Can you prove you're a 'Genius'
										or will you end up being an 'Eg-no-ra-moose'?</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="image"><img src="images/img4.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the 3-d Tic-Tac-Toe Project" /></span>
										<h3><b>3-D Tic-Tac-Toe</b></h3>
										<p>Developed using the Pygame Zero game engine on the MU python editor, this project simulates a game of
										3-dimensional tic-tac-toe. In order to simulate this new take on tic-tac-toe, I used a 3-d array to represent the
										different positions on the board and created a function which could be used to check the 49 different win conditions.
										I still have yet to add logic which will declare the player that won the match and checks if there's
										a tie. That is if that's even possible.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="image"><img src="images/img6.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the Contigo Project" /></span>
										<h3><b>Contigo</b></h3>
										<p>Developed using the Pygame Zero game engine on the MU python editor, this project is intended to simulate a game of Contigo. This card game has two players compete to create three groups of three cards of the same suit or of three consecutive numbers. 
										This project is incomplete as I've run into issues trying to translate the actions a player can take during a given turn into logic. In the most recent version of this project, 
										I've written classes to represent the deck of cards and the players, both of which contain functions that can only initialize the game.
										I hope to return to this project in the future in order to simulate the game properly.</p>

									<h2>Work Experience</h2>
									<p>As of now, I have only held one job that is related to the field of Computer Science. In the future, I hope that I will find opportunities
									to gain some more work experience so that I can place it here.</p>
